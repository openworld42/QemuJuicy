# QemuJuicy

### QEMU Java User Interface Contributed Yet

.

#### QemuJuicy is still alpha and under development, features may be missing

(if you miss something, come back here to watch the progress in 2-3 weeks or create an issue on Github)

.


**QemuJuicy** is a graphical user interface to run [QEMU](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) (a virtual machine emulator). QEMU can run on many operating systems and on a lot of CPUs by software emulation - e.g. Linux on Windows, Windows on Unix, Suse under Ubuntu, Debian on macOS, all on Linux, ARM CPUs, historical machines or operating systems, and others.

**QemuJuicy** is Open Source Software (FOSS, see licenses) and a Java(tm) application running on many OS/machines, QEMU is also Open Source (GPLv2).

You need:

* **Java** installed (from your package manager or from [here](https://openjdk.java.net/) (Linux, Windows, macOS, others).
* **QEMU** installed (package manager or from [here](https://www.qemu.org) - Linux, Windows, macOS, source)
* **QemuJuicy** JAR file: **qemujuicy_vN.N.N.jar** (N.N.N is the version) from [github.com](https://github.com/openworld42/QemuJuicy) or package manager
* (an operating system, e.g. as a *.iso file or CD/DVD/Live-CD, that you want to run or install as a virtual machine on your computer)

Run **QemuJuicy** on command line (or create a menu/desktop entry/shell script) using:

**java -jar qemujuicy_vN.N.N.jar**  

Follow the setup wizard and 
create/run your first VM (virtual machine) with **QemuJuicy**.    
Read the [documentation](https://github.com/openworld42/QemuJuicy/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) before or simply try it out, if tl;dr.

Think about [contribution](https://github.com/openworld42/QemuJuicy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md).
