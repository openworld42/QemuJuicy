:tropical_drink: &nbsp; **QemuJuicy** is a graphical user interface to run [QEMU](https://github.com/qemu/qemu) (a virtual machine emulator). QEMU can run on many operating systems and on a lot of CPUs by software emulation - e.g. Linux on Windows, Windows on Unix, Suse under Ubuntu, Debian on macOS, all on Linux, ARM CPUs, historical machines or operating systems, and others.

:open_book: &nbsp; **QemuJuicy** is Open Source Software (FOSS, see licenses) and a Java(tm) application running on many OS/machines, QEMU is also Open Source (GPLv2).

You need:

* :coffee: &nbsp; **Java** installed (version >= **17+**, package manager or from [here](https://openjdk.java.net/) (Windows, macOS, others).<br />
* :bird: &nbsp; **QEMU** installed (package manager or from [here](https://www.qemu.org) - Linux, Windows, macOS, source)<br />
* :tropical_drink: &nbsp; **QemuJuicy** JAR file: **qemujuicy_vN.N.N.jar** (N.N.N is the version) from [github.com](https://github.com/openworld42/QemuJuicy) or package manager<br />
* :dvd: &nbsp; An operating system, e.g. as a *.iso file or CD/DVD/Live-CD, that you want to run or install as a virtual machine on your computer<br />

Run **QemuJuicy** on the command line (or create a menu/desktop entry/shell script) using:

**java -jar qemujuicy_vN.N.N.jar**  

where **N.N.N** is the version.

Follow the setup wizard and create/run your first VM (virtual machine) with **QemuJuicy**.    
Read the [documentation](https://github.com/openworld42/QemuJuicy/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) before or use **QemuJuicys** help (Menu Help), or simply try it out, if tl;dr.
