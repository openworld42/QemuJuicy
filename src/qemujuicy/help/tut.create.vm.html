  <h1>Create a VM</h1>
  <div>A virtual machine usually has a virtual "harddisk" (a file on the host system) and
  	some properties, which define how start and handle the VM (e.g. how much memory or cores 
  	are used) and the associated virtual hardware (e.g. an USB port, a network chip/card or a 
  	virtual sound driver). To make this VM creation easy, just start the Vm creation wizard, a button 
  	to the right of <b>QemuJuicy</b>:</div>
  <p><img src="../images/oxygen32x32/Oxygen480-actions-list-add.svg.png" width="24" height="24" alt="Vm creation wizard"></p>
  	
  <p>All of these buttons have tool tips if you stay on them, explaining their function.</p>
  	
  <p>The wizard will guide through the VM creation. Choose an operating system (OS) for the VM, a unique VM name or
  	 - if you like - another image icon. Set the maximum hard disk size. The real size of the virtual disk will be much less than 
  	that if the file system of the OS supports holes (common for Linux or Windows) and grows automatically with the space needed, 
  	using <b>QEMUs</b> "<i>qcow2</i>" disk format.</p>
  	
  <p>Choose all other properties and press the "<i>Finish</i>" button. A virtual machine will be created, its properties 
  	are set to specified values or defaults. In addition, the virtual harddisk will be initialized.</p>
  	
 <p>The new VM will show up in the VM list with its icon and its properties are shown within the tabbed pane on the right side.</p>
