  <h1>First start</h1>
  <p>Starting <b>QemuJuicy</b> the first time displays a setup wizard to guide through <b>QemuJuicys</b> setup.</p>
  <p>At the first step, <b>QemuJuicy</b> tries to guess all necessary <b>QEMU</b> programms.
  	The directory containing the <b>QEMU</b> installation can be selected, if the <b>QEMU</b> installation 
  	directory has not been found automatically. If the automated setup succeeds, the wizard displays 
  	"Success" and the version of the <b>QEMU</b> programms.</p>
  <p>Second, several general settings of <b>QemuJuicy</b> can be set.</p>
  <p>Next, <b>QemuJuicy</b> needs to know where to store its log file and settings.
  	Important is the directory to store the VM harddisk files and properties of the virtual machines.
  	Harddisk file can easily grow to tens of gigabytes, if the installed operating system 
  	occupies much space. Depending on the individual backup strategy, one might choose another place
  	to store the VM harddisk files.</p>
  <p>Note: the values can be changed later calling the <i>File</i> -> <i>Settings</i> dialog.</p>
