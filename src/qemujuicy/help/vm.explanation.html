  <h1>Virtual machine (explanation)</h1>
  <div>A "<i>Virtual machine</i>" (VM) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. 
  	VMs provide functionality close to a physical computer. 
  	A VM may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of both. 
  	The layer between the operating system between the host and the VM (the guest system) is called a hypervisor.
  	A hypervisor could be based completely on software, but nowadays many computers assist 
  	virtualization through specialized hardware. Therefore, a host system can "host" many guest systems,
  	with the same or different kinds of emulated hardware. In addition, different operating systems may be used 
  	at the same time on the same hardware machine.</div>
  
  <p>In contrary, "<i>Containers</i>" (e.g. Docker) may be used to separate software systems and provide another
  	method of "soft" virtualization. Containers and the host share the same operating system, 
  	being separated from each other. There is no hardware or software emulation, and only one OS. 
  	This has less OS possibilities and needs more setup effort, with the advantage of better 
  	hardware efficiency, parallelization and management of large high-availability clusters.</p>
  	
  <p>QEMU</b> contains different virtualization emulators using several hypervisors, depending of the 
  	architecture of the host and the virtualized guest systems. From the guest systems view, it runs on its
  	own hardware and doesn't (usually) know about the host system or other VMs.</p>
  	
  <p>There is more detailed information within the WWW, Wikipedia is a good starting point.</p>
