  <h1>Run a virtual machine</h1>
  <div>Run a VM, which has an operating system (OS) installed already, by clicking the "run" button, to boot 
  	the VM from the virtual harddisk:</div>

  <p>As an alternative for booting from the virtual harddisk, <b>QemuJuicys</b> "<i>QEMU boot menu</i>" property can be set, 
  	choosing the source for a boot directly in the VMs emulator window. 
  	A un-check of "<i>QEMU boot menu</i>" speeds up the boot process, not waiting for an user action.</p>
  
  <p>It is necessary, that the "<i>Architecture</i>" property (the emulator) of the VM matches the 
  	architecture of the virtual machine OS.</p>
 
  <p>If the VM virtual harddisk has no OS installed, consider using a "once-only-start", asking for an image file to 
  	boot from (see help chapter "Install an operating system"):</p>

  <p>Live Systems might not need a harddisk, cause they run very often from an "<i>*.iso</i>" file without persistency or from CD/DVD. 
  	In that case, one may use the "once-only-start" button instead of the run button.<br> 
  	<b>QemuJuicys</b> remembers the directory from where the last "<i>*.iso</i>" file was selected.</p>
  	
  <p>Note: An unused virtual harddisk (qcow2 format) does not consume much disk space, regardless of the 
  	maximum disk size value.</p>
