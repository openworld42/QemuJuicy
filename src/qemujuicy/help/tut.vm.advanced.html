  <h1>Advanced Tab Usage</h1>
  <div>The tabbed pane on the right side of <b>QemuJuicys</b> has a tab "<i>Advanced</i>".</div>
  <p><img src="../images/oxygen32x32/Oxygen-actions-im-aim.svg.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Install once"></p>
  
  <p>If using a generic VM in a usual way only, one might ignore this tab, but <b>QemuJuicys</b> 
  	"<i>Advanced</i>"</div> tab offers several possibilities.</p>
  	
  <p>It has two radio buttons and two text areas. The default "<i>Add special QEMU parameters</i>"
  	button displays in the upper area all <b>QEMU</b> parameters created automatically by <b>QemuJuicy</b>,
  	taking all defined VM properties. This text area cannot be changed or edited, but copied into the clipboard
  	for further usage. Missing or special <b>QEMU</b> parameters may be added within the lower text area, 
  	using the same style as above.<br>
  	Clicking the button "<i>Full QEMU definitions</i>" changes this behaviour. Now the user is completely
  	responsible for the upper text area, regardless of the settings of VM properties (they are ignored). 
  	Any parameters from
  	the lower text area are added, if the VM is started. Changing the radio buttons will not change the 
	"<i>Full QEMU definitions</i>" content, it is saved and survives a <b>QemuJuicy</b> exit.</p>
	
  <p>This offers some possibilities:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>
      Add <b>QEMU</b> parameters not known to <b>QemuJuicy</b>. And yes, there are many
      of them, take a look at "<i>www.qemu.org</i>" -> main documentation section.
    </li>
    <li>
      To add special parameter options by setting a VM property to "<i>None/Advanced Tab</i>" and 
      adding the specialiced, more complex parameter option within the lower text area.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up a VM, use the "<i>Copy</i>" button or context menu to use the complete text for
      further use (on a CLI/shell).
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up a VM, use the "<i>Store</i>" button to write the <b>QEMU</b> call of this VM to a file.
      This file - made executable - may be used as a starter for VMs, <b>QemuJuicy</b> doesn't need to run.
      Complex networking between the VMs (some tens of them) might find this helpful, or a shell 
      or *.bat file can be used as a menu entry to start a VM.
    </li>
    <li>
      In small to medium VM environments (some tens of VMs, several servers), <b>QemuJuicy</b> can be used 
      to develop, test and modify the VMs. Use the "<i>Store</i>" button to save the <b>QEMU</b> call, copy
      the shell/batch file together with the virtual harddisk to the server and start the (now remote) VM 
      on that server (possibly using ssh, sshfs).<b>
      Simple, quick solution, no overhead, easy to handle, secure: yes, all components could be Open Source.
     </li>
    <li>
      Copying VMs with specialized parameters, including their virtual harddisks.
    </li>
    <li>
      Varying parameters in a GUI for testing, using <b>QemuJuicy</b> as a starter.
    </li>
    <li>
      Using <b>QemuJuicy</b> just as a starter, setting the complete <b>QEMU</b> command with 
      "<i>Full QEMU definitions</i>". This could be used for rare VMs, like FPGA machines, 
      having one place (<b>QemuJuicy</b>)  to manage all VMs.
    </li>
  </ul>
