  <h1>Virtual machine properties</h1>
  <div>A virtual machine uses some properties, which define how start and handle the VM.
  	These are the amount of host memory or host cores are used when running the VM, as an example.
  	In addition, the associated virtual hardware (e.g. an USB port, a network chip/card or a 
  	virtual sound driver) may be defined.
  	The properties of the currently selected VM are shown within the tabbed pane on the right side.
  	After creation, take a quick look over the properties of the VM on all the tabs of the tabbed pane, 
  	to ensure that they are correct.</div>
  <p>Note: the properties of a VM cannot be changed if the VM is running. 
  	Most <b>QEMU</b> call parameters are constructed from these properties. </p>

  <h2>Important VM properties</h2>
  <div>Two properties are important: the VM name has to be unique and the "<i>Architecture</i>" will 
  	define the <b>QEMU</b> emulator.
  	As an example, the <i>Architecture</i> (emulator) "<i>PC x86 (64 bit)</i>" is used to run Windows or a Linux compiled for PCs,
  	where "<i>ARM64 (AArch64)</i>" will emulate an ARM processor (e.g. a Raspberry Pi).</div> 
  	
  <h2>Other VM properties</h2>
  <div>Properties showing "<i>Best guess</i>" use the best guess assumption of <b>QemuJuicy</b>, taking into account
  	the host and guest operating system, and the emulated hardware. One can have a look to this "Best guess" on the 
  	"<i>Advanced</i>" tab by analyzing the <b>QEMU</b> parameters choosen by <b>QemuJuicy</b>.</div> 
  	
  <p>Due to the fact, that a situation might call for a special treatment which cannot be handled by <b>QemuJuicy</b>, 
  	some properties offer the choice "<i>None/Advanced Tab</i>". On selection of this choice, this property will not be set. 
  	One might set another value using the "<i>None/Advanced Tab</i>", which has its own help chapter description.</p>
