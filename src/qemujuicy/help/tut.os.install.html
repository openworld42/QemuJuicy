  <h1>Install an operating system</h1>
  <div>An empty virtual machine hard disk will need an operating system (OS) installed to run the VM.
  	Very often, the operating system has been downloaded from the World Wide Web as an "<i>*.iso</i>" file
  	(e.g. "<i>ubuntu-VERSION-desktop-amd64.iso</i>" or more special "<i>archlinux-VERSION-x86_64.iso</i>").
  	Another, less usual/older possibility is an operating system on a CD/DVD.</div>
  <p>To install the OS, the VM can be started once from the "<i>*.iso</i>" file or CD/DVD, but afterwards boot
  	always from the VMs harddisk (except a reinstall, overwriting the old system).</p>
  <p><b>QemuJuicy</b> supports this, using a "once-only-start", asking for an image file to boot from: choose 
  	an "<i>*.iso</i>" file within a file selection dialog ("<i>/dev/cdrom</i>" should also work on most 
  	Linux/Unix systems, otherwise rip the CD/DVD content to an "<i>*.iso</i>" file). The "once-only-start" button is:</p>

  <p>When the installation process has been finished, operating systems either reboot automatically or simply halt.
  	<b>QemuJuicys</b> "once-only-start" button sets the proper <b>QEMU</b> parameter if a reboot happens,
  	booting the second time from the VMs virtual harddisk.</p>

  <p>After the successful installation , use <b>QemuJuicys</b> "run" button to boot the VM from the virtual harddisk:</p>
  <p><img src="../images/oxygen128x128/Oxygen480-actions-arrow-right.svg.png" width="32" height="32" alt="Install once"></p>
  
  <p>As an alternative for OS installation, <b>QemuJuicys</b> "<i>QEMU boot menu</i>" property can be set, choosing the source 
  	for a boot directly in the VMs emulator window. A un-check of "<i>QEMU boot menu</i>" afterwards speeds up the boot 
  	process, not waiting for an user action.</p>
  	
  <p>Note: Live Systems dont need a harddisk, cause they run very often from an "<i>*.iso</i>" file or CD/DVD without 
  	an installed system on the harddisk. In that case, one may use the "once-only-start" button several times.<br> 
  	<b>QemuJuicys</b> remembers the directory from where the last "<i>*.iso</i>" file was selected.
  	An unused virtual harddisk (qcow2 format) does not consume much disk space, regardless of the 
  	maximum disk size value.</p>
