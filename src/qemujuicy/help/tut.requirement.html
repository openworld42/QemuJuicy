  <h1>Prerequisites / Requirements</h1>
  <p>To run <b>QemuJuicy</b> it is necessary to have <b>QEMU</b> installed (www.qemu.org) 
  	on your host system (very often the computer you sit in front of),
  	since <b>QEMU</b> - a pack of applications - contains the simulators for various VMs. In addition,
  	tools like <i>"qemu-img"</i> are used by <b>QemuJuicy</b> to create a 
  	virtual "harddisk" of a VM, if the VM is installed on it. 
  	The "harddisk" is usually a file on your host system.
 	There is also the possibility to run a Live System from a CD/DVD or an ISO file,
 	which is downloaded or taken from a CD/DVD.</p>
  <p><b>QemuJuicy</b> needs "<i>qemu-img</i>" to create/copy/convert VM harddisks, and
  	one or more emulators for virtual machines. <b>QEMU</b> has emulators for many hardware systems.
  	Each emulator for a specific computer hardware starts with "<i>qemu-system-*</i>", where the "*" 
  	describes the hardware (e.g. <i>qemu-system-x86_64</i> the 64-bit CPUs for AMD and Intel).</p>
  <p><b>QemuJuicy</b> will handle this for you at the first start to guess all necessary applications.
  	If you change your <b>QEMU</b> installation later, you may wish to recheck for this using 
  	the <i>File -> Settings</i> menu item, selecting the <b>QEMU</b> installation directory.</p>
  	
  <h2>Linux / Unix / macOS hosts</h2>
  	Usually, <b>QEMU</b> is already available through your package manager, and after installation 
  	located at <i>/usr/bin</i> or on another place of your <i>$PATH</i> variable. If you are interested:
  	"<i>type qemu-img</i>" might show you the directory, 
  	"<i>ls /usr/bin/qemu*</i>" lists the installed hardware emulators and some <b>QEMU</b> tools.
  	<b>QemuJuicy</b> will find it automatically in most cases.
  	
  <h2>Windows hosts</h2>
  	To install <b>QEMU</b> on Windows, download it from <i>www.qemu.org</i> -> Download -> Windows 
  	and install it, using the <i>exe</i> or <i>msi</i> file. Most likely, <b>QEMU</b> is installed
  	somewhere in "<i>C:\Program Files\qemu</i>". Mind the space within "Program Files". 
  	<b>QemuJuicy</b> will try to find it automatically. To use the <b>QEMU</b> commands on 
  	the command line, you might need to add the path to the environment variable "<i>%PATH%</i>".
  	
  <h2>Other hosts</h2>
  	<b>QEMU</b> comes also as source. Compile it, find the installation directory and choose this 
  	directory within the setup wizard to select the <b>QEMU</b> programms for <b>QemuJuicy</b>.
   	
  <h2>Proof installation if you want, problems</h2>
  	Find the <b>QEMU</b>installation directory and choose this 
  	directory within the setup wizard to select the <b>QEMU</b> programms for <b>QemuJuicy</b>.
  <p>A "<i>qemu-img --version</i>", showing the version on the command line - maybe in the right 
  	directory or put in front - gives a proof of a correct installation.</p>
