  <h1>Prereqisites / Requirements</h1>
  <p>To run <strong>QemuJuicy</strong> it is necessary to have <b>QEMU</b> installed (www.qemu.org)
  	is a software emulator for several hardware machines (processors, CPUs). 
  	It uses various hypervisors to emulate hardware.</p>
  <p>This tutorial is a help and a description for using <strong>QemuJuicy</strong>.</p>
  <p>In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. 
  	Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a 
  	physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, 
  	software, or a combination (from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine).</p>
  <p>The computer running the virtual machine (QemuJuicy/QEMU) is usually called the "host", 
  	the virtual machine (the emulated system) is called "guest" or "client".
	A host can run many guests.</p>
