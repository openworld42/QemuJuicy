# QemuJuicy Contribution

First of all, thanks for thinking about contributing to **QemuJuicy**.

Contribution can be coding, but there are a lot of other tasks to do, as pointed out in the following (ideas are appreciated):

* **Translation**: Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, (German: work in progress), ... 

* **Testing**: Windows 10/11, Macs, non-Debians, ... 

* **Documentation**: a wiki, plain HTML, (or javahelp?) 

* **Information**: environment/paths for non-Debians, non-windows machines

* **Testing** other CPUs/VMs: Arm (Raspi), MIPS, ... 
	
* **Package managers**: Debian, others, ... 
	
* **Use cases**: common usage, QEMU options, ideas (real causes)
	
* **Bugs**: submit what you have done, what happens, and the log file (log.txt)
	
* **Public relations**, if we are ready for it
	
* **A Github star**, if you like it, or want it ;-)

Contribute/communicate either through

* Mail: github@silberbauer.xyz   (serious subjects only), or

* a Github issue: [github.com](https://github.com/openworld42/QemuJuicy/issues)


If desired, for a fairly serious contribution, you get an entry in **QemuJuicy**'s *About -> Contribution* dialog.

**Please keep in mind to precisely define your issues, in case of bugs include the .qemujuicy/log.txt file**
